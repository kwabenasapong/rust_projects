## Writing and Running a Rust Program
All rust programs are saved as '.rs' 
To run the program in linux you must do the ff;
* type "rustc program_name.rs" to compile program
* type "./program_name" to execute program

## How to use Cargo summarized:
* To create a project use "cargo new".
* To build a project use "cargo build".
* To build and run a project in one step use "cargo run".
* To build a project without producing a binary to check for errors use "cargo check".
* Instead of saving the result of the build in the same directory as our code, Cargo stores it in the target/debug directory.
* An additional advantage of using Cargo is that the commands are the same no matter which operating system you’re working on.
